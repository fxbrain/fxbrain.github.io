          <section class="content"><p>It is confusing how often it happens that I ask customers about their stack in
use and how often they barely can answer this simple&nbsp;question.</p>
<hr>
<h3 id="why-would-i-ask-this-">Why would I ask&nbsp;this?</h3>
<p>Simply and primarily because I am really interested. Furthermore it is quite a
social interaction on a developer niveau. It helps me, make
decisions about technology I choose in&nbsp;production.</p>
<p>When I am asking this question I am interested in these&nbsp;points:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is working for&nbsp;them.</li>
<li>What is it they like&nbsp;using.</li>
<li>What is it that completely falls over and they hate and&nbsp;why.</li>
<li>What is their&nbsp;workflow.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a freelancer, being in an interview, I think these are <strong><span class="caps">THE</span></strong> most
important questions you can/must ask. If properly answered they’ll give you
deep insights on not only how they’re doing things, but what the reasons are
for them to contact&nbsp;you.</p>
<p>If they’re unable to answer this cogently, well, then the project is
already in a completely flawed condition and you should maybe just …&nbsp;run?</p>
<p>Well, if they want you as a&nbsp;developer.</p>
<p>If they can’t really answer and want to you to fix this? <strong>Perfect!</strong></p>
<p>Code is and will always be a <strong>disposable product</strong>. There is only a minor
amount in every code-base I know, which is fixed and not due to change/die.
There are enough developers out there producing code. Of course that does
not mean the code created is necessarily good. But this is not my&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>For any problem there will be some code approximating some solution over
the&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>The older I get the more a lazy programmer I become. I am more and more
heading towards a mental state where I think that the best code is probably
that one that I haven’t written or to put it differently. The less lines
of code I write, the more stable the system&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>My interest has changed over the years. Today I find myself truly happy
using git, a bunch of compilers, strace, perftool, npm etc. Finding the
weird and puzzling bug in a distributed system is what makes me&nbsp;tick.</p>
<p>But for all this you have to be very profound in using tools and get a
feeling for the right tool for the&nbsp;job.</p>
<p>What I’ve encountered through all these years freelancing in projects,
that the proper choice of a stack is one of the biggest issues to&nbsp;solve.</p>
<p>But, a proper stack is not resulting necessarily in a proper workflow.
The latter is where the art&nbsp;is.</p>
<p>Fairly often I come into companies with some decent choice of a stack
and a completely messed up&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>A <span class="caps">STACK</span> DOES NOT INDUCE&nbsp;WORKFLOW!</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A decent choice of a stack is an experience matter, establishing a likewise
decent workflow is more approximative by&nbsp;nature.</p>
